This is a doctest based regression suite for intersection.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.
It can be run from CLI with 'python3 -m doctest intersection_doctest.txt'

>>> from robot_control import *

>>> arm = Arm(seed = 0)
>>> arm.get_random_config()
